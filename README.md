# Minecraft Chat Rust

### Aim
This rust crate aims to provide an easy-to-use object hierarchy
to manage raw JSON-messages sent over the minecraft protocol.

Serialization and Deserialization is done using [serde](https://serde.rs) (such a nice library!❤️).

Using a version indication, different styles are automatically ignored for older versions.

### Goals
- [x] Serialization/Deserialization to json.
- [] Complete missing elements.
- [] Add a 'legacy' text format.

### Contributing
Please feel free to contribute to this repository. Any help is welcome!

(I'm also pretty sure there are some people out there who know how to improve this crate by a bunch,
so any advice is appreciated!)
