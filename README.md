# Minecraft Chat Rust

### Aim
This rust crate aims to provide an easy-to-use object hierarchy
to manage raw JSON-messages sent over the minecraft protocol.

Serialization and Deserialization will be using [serde](https://serde.rs)
but still needs some work.

If we could get this to become well-structured, this would have the potential
to become a nice addition to the large collection of often-used Rust crates.
